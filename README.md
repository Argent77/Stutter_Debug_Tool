# Stutter Debug Tool
A help to debug script malfunctions in IE games.

The Stutter Debug Tool is to help debug script malfunctions in the game. For example, if an NPC "stutters", i.e. only walks a few steps and constantly terminates any actions, or if the NPC's PID (player initiated dialogue) pops up repeatedly.
Also, if the game experiences a lag which could be caused by a looping script.

The Stutter Debug Tool will patch every script block with a text stating which script and script block number is running. The text is shown in the textbox ingame and also right above the entity executing the script.
